# minimalistic-ml
A collection of basic ML programs

With the availability of open source libraries such as Tensor Flow, scikit-learn, etc., machine learning (ML) tools are now easily accessible to 
everyone. But such a trend has made ML a mere "black box". 

However, it is important for practioners to look inside this blackbox and understand the underlying principles. This understanding is very
crucial for effective usage of ML libraries.
This repository aims at delivering very minimalistic programs to understand basic concepts in a very limited time.

It contains/will contain :)

- Gradient descent - A simple optimization tool
- Linear regression
- Support Vector Machines
